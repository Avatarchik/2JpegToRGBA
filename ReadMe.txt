========================================================================
    CONSOLE APPLICATION : 2JpegToRGBA Project Overview
========================================================================

Jpeg does not support alpha channel, that is why this utility was written.

This app takes 2 Jpeg images: colored and grayscaled(it will be used as alpha for colored) and 
create RGBA image (it saved as PNG file).

Later it will be tested for loading PNG vs Jpeg(colored and grayscaled).
